> When I started working on Hollow back in February, I didn't think how large this project would become. It all began with a random thought during school about having a fully peer-to-peer messenger where you're in control of all your data. Then I started planning, researching, locking in the tech stack, and grinding more than full-time to build it.
>
> You can look at the old commits. I tried libp2p that kept failing and then the layout has been rebuilt too. Claude was basically my development tool that always helped me. I might not be the best programmer, but I have engineering thinking and creativity to know what needs to be built and how. Every architecture decision was mine, I traced every bug/performance issue and then we fixed it together, but I'm the one who's in control of what I release. And I'm not planning to publish unusable software that works like total garbage.
>
> As for Hollow, I made it open-source because I want people to have software they can trust, own a copy of, and run themselves. It should be accessible to every regular user who just wants to chat with their friends, with everything working out of the box and have actual privacy/security that's easily verifiable. This is the reason why I adopted modern E2EE protocols and built custom implementations to create the messenger I would want to use myself.

> Hollow won't have paywalls. Ever. No matter how much money someone is willing to pay, Hollow will stay open for everybody. Contributors are welcome because we can come together on a single matter that is taken away from us every single day - privacy and ownership. You deserve it. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.

## Overview

Hollow is a fully distributed, end-to-end encrypted communication platform. There are no central servers that store your messages or files. Members of a server collectively host it. The relay is a zero-knowledge signaling pipe that forwards encrypted blobs between peers without any ability to read, modify, or store them.

Your identity is a cryptographic keypair. Zero registrations. One recovery phrase or export of your identity into .hollow file, and you own your account forever.

## Features

- **End-to-end encrypted messaging** -- Olm (Double Ratchet) for DMs, OpenMLS for servers. Forward secrecy by default
- **Encrypted voice and video calls** -- peer-to-peer WebRTC with SFrame (AES-128-GCM)
- **Screen sharing** -- with system audio capture (Windows), encrypted with the same SFrame pipeline
- **File sharing** -- encrypted peer-to-peer transfers with no size limits. Large files (>34 MB) use Hollow Share (hidden BitTorrent-like distribution)
- **Distributed storage (Vault)** -- erasure-coded encrypted shards distributed across server members. Files survive even when individual peers go offline
- **Servers and channels** -- create communities with text channels, voice channels, roles, and permissions. All state synchronized via CRDTs with no authoritative server. Optional: secure Twitch verification to limit members only to your followers/subs
- **Custom relay support** -- self-host your own relay for a fully isolated network. One `docker compose up` and you're running
- **Cryptographic identity** -- Ed25519 keypair from a BIP-39 mnemonic. No accounts, no passwords, no email or phone verification
- **Full local data retention** -- using the Archive tab, you can see all the messages saved in your local database that you can easily export
- **Verifiable messages** -- every message is Ed25519-signed. Exported conversations are cryptographically unforgeable
- **Native TLS** -- the relay handles TLS 1.3 directly (no Cloudflare, no reverse proxy). ~572,000 concurrent connections on a single $8/month VPS (see [BENCHMARK.md](relay-uws/BENCHMARK.md))

## Self-Hosting

Hollow supports self-hosted relays for fully isolated networks, so only connected users in it can communicate between each other without the official network.

```bash
cd relay-uws
cp .env.example .env              # set your domain, IP, TURN secret
cp turnserver.conf.example turnserver.conf
docker compose up -d
```

In the Hollow app, enter your relay domain during setup or in Settings. See [relay-uws/README.md](relay-uws/README.md) for full documentation.
