## Current Phase
**Phase 6.25: Security & Optimization Audit — COMPLETE (Apr 5, 2026).** 21 findings all fixed. VPS hardened. TURN ICE config bug fixed (split URIs into separate entries). Voice calls confirmed working cross-internet via STUN P2P.

**Phase 6.75: Polish & Launch Prep — IN PROGRESS.**

**Phase 5B: Voice & Video — COMPLETE (Apr 4, 2026).**
- **1:1 voice calls: DONE.** Separate RTCPeerConnection for voice. Full call flow + signaling. Tested cross-internet.
- **Device selection: DONE.** Input: `sourceId` constraint. Output: `win32audio` + `Helper.selectAudioOutput()`.
- **1:1 video calls: DONE.** Side-by-side + fullscreen. Tested cross-internet.
- **Screen sharing: DONE.** Separate `RTCPeerConnection` per direction (`ScreenShareService`). `getDisplayMedia()` + `addTrack()` on fresh PC. Quality picker (360p-4K, 5-60 FPS, default 1080p60). Camera independent (stays on voice PC). Bidirectional sharing works. 3 Rust signal types: `screen_offer/answer/ice`.
- **Screen share layout: DONE.** Full-bleed screen fills entire chat pane. Chat overlay (360px right, toggleable) + controls pill (bottom center) auto-fade after 1s inactivity. Pinned while hovering/typing.
- **TURN server: DEPLOYED.** Coturn on VPS. HMAC-SHA1 credentials via relay `/turn-credentials`. IceConfigProvider refreshes every 50 min.
- **ICE config:** Own coturn STUN + Cloudflare + Google STUN + TURN (UDP/TCP/TLS).
- **Custom ringtone: DONE.** `audioplayers`, file path in SQLCipher, volume slider, trim editor.
- **Audio quality presets: DONE.** Voice (32k mono), Music (128k stereo), Hi-Fi (256k stereo). SDP Opus fmtp munging.
- **Per-peer volume: DONE.** `Helper.setVolume()` on remote receiver track. Right-click popup (0-200%).
- **Voice channels: DONE.** Channel type system (text/voice). Full-mesh WebRTC (2-5 users). MLS-encrypted join/leave broadcast + targeted SDP/ICE. Sidebar tiles with participant list + mute/deafen indicators (stacked). Vertical shimmer for connected channels. Voice control panel (mute/deafen/disconnect). Audio state broadcast to peers. VAD speaking indicator (local via `record` package, remote via getStats). Join/leave fade animations. Per-peer volume (right-click compact overlay). Compact overlay popup also replaces old DM volume popup.
- **Gossip relay tree: DONE.** Unified gossip overlay for file broadcasting + voice channel scaling. `gossip.rs` module: `GossipOverlay` (6-12 neighbors per server, 50 total cap), `PeerScore` (latency/uptime/bandwidth/shard overlap), 5-min rotation, broadcast dedup (60s TTL), `PendingRelay` for file relay flow. File broadcast: 6+ member channel files sent to gossip neighbors → auto-relay with TTL decrement → 1000+ members in ~3 hops. 30s fallback to direct `FileProbe`. Voice gossip: partial-mesh audio PCs to gossip neighbors only (not all participants), `onTrack` forwarding with `_forwardedSources` dedup, hysteresis (6 up / 4 down). `PeerExchange` every 2 min for topology discovery. <6 members keep current eager behavior. 26 Rust tests.
- **Profile sync: FIXED.** 6 fixes: restored empty plaintext broadcast (DM peers), profile re-send on reconnect (PeerJoined/RoomMembers), `ProfileRequest` message type, startup broadcast, timestamp tolerance (24h clock skew), member display_name update. Server avatar CRDT now emits `ServerUpdated` (was `SyncCompleted`).
- **SFrame E2EE: DONE.** Full end-to-end encryption on all voice audio frames. `FrameCryptorService` wraps flutter_webrtc's `FrameCryptor`+`KeyProvider` (AES-128-GCM). DM calls: caller generates 32-byte key, sends in Olm-encrypted `CallInvite`. Server voice channels: key derived from MLS epoch secret via `export_secret("sframe")`. Key auto-rotates on MLS membership changes via `MlsEpochChanged` event. Both tested cross-internet, `FrameCryptorStateOk` on both sides. 2 new MLS tests (export + rotation).
- **Voice channel screen sharing: DONE.** Separate `ScreenShareService` per direction per peer. `createOfferFromStream()` shares one capture across N outgoing PCs. 4 new Rust `MessageEnvelope` variants (`vc_screen_offer/answer/ice/state`) via MLS. `role` field on ICE candidates routes to correct PC (outgoing vs incoming). Full-bleed layout: chat overlay (360px right, toggleable) + floating controls pill (auto-fade 1s). Late joiner support (screen_state + screen_offer on PeerJoined, early ICE queue). Voice channels selectable in sidebar (click joined VC → main pane shows ChannelChatPane). Screen share button in VoiceChannelPanel. Auto-select first text channel on leave.
- **Voice channel camera video: DONE.** Camera toggle in VC, per-peer video grid (1-5 tiles), click-to-fullscreen with PiP thumbnails, mixed mode switcher (screen+camera sources with icons), chat overlay, SFrame E2EE on video tracks. 3 new Rust `MessageEnvelope` variants (`vc_reneg_offer/answer`, `vc_camera_state`). Key fixes: leave-first-then-cleanup ordering prevents disconnect blocking, renderer kept alive across camera off/on cycles (onTrack doesn't fire on transceiver reuse), screen share offer deferred to onPeerConnected callback.
- **Crash logging: DONE.** `hollow_crash.log` captures Flutter framework errors (`FlutterError.onError`) and platform/async errors (`PlatformDispatcher.onError`). 5MB rotation. Located alongside `hollow_debug.log` in data dir.
- **Next:** Phase 6.25 (security & optimization audit), then Phase 6.75 polish.

**Phase 5A: WebRTC Data Channels — COMPLETE (Mar 29, 2026).** P2P file/shard streaming via WebRTC data channels. flutter_webrtc 1.4.1 (libwebrtc m144). ~9 MB/s throughput, tested up to 131MB. 85-90% of heavy transfers bypass relay. STUN only (no TURN yet). WSS relay fallback for symmetric NAT. Keepalive pings (30s), auto-reconnect, early-arrival handling, `getBufferedAmount()` backpressure.

**Phase 7: libp2p Full Removal — COMPLETE (Mar 27-28, 2026).** libp2p fully removed. WSS relay is sole transport. ed25519-dalek replaces libp2p identity. Relay server simplified (signaling + WS only). 184 tests pass.
**Phase 5 (old): WebSocket Relay — COMPLETE (Mar 25-26).** All messages + file streaming via WSS.
**Phase 6 (old): Pure MLS for Servers — COMPLETE (Mar 26-27).** Servers = MLS, DMs = Olm, transport = WS.

**Phase 4: Shared Vault — COMPLETE.** Phases 1-3.75 all COMPLETE.

**Phase 4 — Shared Vault — Distributed Storage (started Mar 16, 2026):**
Distributed file storage across server members. 14 major items, ~90 sub-tasks. Key design decisions:
- **Vault = files/media only.** Messages, CRDTs, server config use existing sync system.
- **Automatic mode:** <6 members → full replication. 6+ members → adaptive Reed-Solomon erasure coding.
- **Adaptive k/m:** scales with member count (k=3/m=2 at 6 → k=20/m=10 at 500+). New content uses current params.
- **DMs stay direct P2P.** No vault involvement.
- **Manifests broadcast to all** (like CRDT ops, not erasure-coded).
- **Rat Files consent:** Small servers (<6), file deletion requires unanimous consent.
- Last 2 items (connection subset management, CRDT sharding) deferred until scaling pain.
- **No VPS deployment needed** — vault is entirely client-side.

**Phase 4 completed (Rust backend + Dart UI wired):**
1. Reed-Solomon erasure coding engine (`vault/erasure.rs`) — 22 tests
2. Content-addressed storage layer (`vault/content_store.rs`) — SHA-256 content_id, StorageTier, vault_shards table. 26 tests
3. Storage pledge system — CRDT `StoragePledgeChanged`, auto-pledge 512MB, `set_storage_pledge()`/`get_storage_stats()` FFI
4. Adaptive k/m engine (`vault/adaptive.rs`) — VaultMode enum, compute_adaptive_params, tier multipliers
5. DHT-based shard placement (`vault/placement.rs`) — XOR distance, weighted per-member caps, vault_placement table
6. Store protocol — ShardStore/ShardStoreAck via Olm metadata + `/hollow/stream/1.0.0` for shard bytes
7. Storage tier config — retention days (files=365d, voice=90d), ShardDelete envelope (MANAGE_SERVER gated)
8. Retrieve protocol — ShardRequest/Response via Olm + stream. Non-uploaders recompute placements via same XOR algorithm
9. File upload pipeline (`vault/pipeline.rs`) — VaultManifest, AES-256-GCM encrypt, prepare_upload (both modes), VaultManifestBroadcast. `vault_upload_file()` FFI
10. File download pipeline — reconstruct_file (erasure decode + AES decrypt), vault cache (`~/.hollow/vault_cache/`). Remote shard fetching: requests missing shards from peers, waits, reconstructs. `vault_download_file()` FFI
11. Vault status indicators — `vault_status_provider.dart`, `_VaultHealthIndicator` in channel header (6+ members only)
12. Rebalancing (`vault/rebalancer.rs`) — departure detection, repair/migration plans, 30-min timer (retention enforcement, LRU cache eviction 1GB)
13. Storage dashboard UI (`storage_dashboard_dialog.dart`) — pledge editor, retention editor, animated progress bars, disk space indicator, member pledges (6+ only)
14. Streaming file transfer — `/hollow/stream/1.0.0` Yamux/QUIC substream (replaced Olm chunks), tested 355MB

**Dart UI integration done:**
- `file_transfer_provider.dart` calls `vaultUploadFile()` for 6+ member servers alongside P2P streaming
- Per-file vault phase text on file cards during vault downloads
- Member panel "Contributing" label for 6+ servers
- Real-time download progress (500ms polling, determinate bar + byte counter)
- File card shows immediately on FileHeaderReceived (not after completion)

**Phase 4 still TODO:**
- Erasure coding not yet tested end-to-end across 6 real peers
- Per-member shard counts in member panel (currently just "Contributing" label)
- Custom shimmer animation for vault file placeholders

122 total vault tests. See `HOLLOW_PLAN.md` for full checklist.

## Hollow Design System (Phase 2.75)
All UI uses custom Hollow widgets — no Material defaults.

- **HollowPressable:** Press: opacity 0.85 + scale 0.98 (spring). Hover: color transition 150ms + shadow lift. `subtle` mode for list items.
- **HollowButton:** 4 variants: `.filled()`, `.ghost()`, `.outline()`, `.danger()`. Props: `onPressed`, `child`, `icon`, `expand`, `compact`.
- **HollowTextField:** `OutlineInputBorder`, animated border (→accent on focus, →error on error), focus glow. Optional `prefixIcon`, `borderRadius`, `isDense`, `showCounter`.
- **HollowDialog:** `showHollowDialog()` — scale 0.95→1.0 + fade, full-screen glassmorphism blur (0→12 sigma).
- **HollowTooltip:** Overlay-based, 400ms delay, fade+slide entrance.
- **HollowToast:** Slide-up + fade, auto-dismiss. Three types: success/error/info. One visible at a time.
- **HollowToggle:** Spring physics thumb, color crossfade track.
- **StatusDot:** Optional `pulse` for breathing glow (3s cycle).

## Key Architecture Notes
- **Peer state tracking in swarm.rs:** `ws_room_peers` (room → peer set), `synced_peers` (HashSet<String>). WS PeerJoined triggers key exchange + sync. 30s keepalive ping in ws_client.rs.
- **Event streaming:** Rust→Dart via `StreamSink` (flutter_rust_bridge). `watch_network_events()` in `api/network.rs`, `EventStreamNotifier` in `event_provider.dart`
- **Navigation shell:** Two layout modes (persisted via `layoutModeProvider`):
  - **Dock mode (default):** FriendsBar (top) | ChannelSidebar + ChatPane + MemberPanel | BottomBar (bottom). Split view support. Home dashboard.
  - **Classic mode:** Discord-like 4-panel — ServerStrip (72px) | ChannelSidebar (240px) | ChatPane | MemberPanel (240px).
  - Responsive: mobile uses bottom nav with single-panel views.
- **Window chrome:** `window_manager` ^0.5.1, `setAsFrameless()`, custom 32px title bar. Known issue: drag-from-maximized doesn't live-redraw until drop (Flutter engine limitation).
- **Theme:** Dark primary + light secondary. `HollowTheme.dark()`/`.light()` + `darkWithHue()`/`lightWithHue()` for custom accent. Toggle via `themeModeProvider`.
- **Icons:** `lucide_icons: ^0.257.0`. All `LucideIcons.*` (camelCase). v0.257.0 uses `alertTriangle`/`alertCircle`. No `cloudCheck` — uses `cloud`.
- `hollow_log!` macro logs to stderr + `hollow_debug.log` (works in release builds, rotates at 10MB)
- Relay: OVH VPS 141.227.186.209, Nginx TLS on 443 → WS 127.0.0.1:9001. Domain: relay.anonlisten.com
- **Transport:** WSS connection to relay (signaling + text/CRDT/MLS) + WebRTC data channels for files/shards (85-90% P2P, WSS fallback) + WebRTC audio for voice calls (separate RTCPeerConnection per call).
- **TURN:** Coturn on VPS (141.227.186.209:3478). Relay `/turn-credentials` generates HMAC-SHA1 creds. `IceConfigProvider` in Dart fetches + auto-refreshes.

## Coding Conventions
- Dart: follow standard `flutter_lints` / `analysis_options.yaml`
- Rust: follow standard `cargo clippy` recommendations
- File naming: snake_case for Dart and Rust files
- No Electron, no Node.js, no web frameworks — Flutter only for UI
- **NEVER pass `WidgetRef ref` as a constructor parameter** to child widgets. Always use `ConsumerWidget` or `ConsumerStatefulWidget` instead. Passing `ref` causes cascade rebuilds.
- Use `AnimatedOpacity` (GPU-composited) for per-item opacity. Never use the `Opacity` widget.
- **Keep Flutter updated:** Windows animation jank was a Flutter engine bug (3.38.5), fixed in 3.41.4. `windows/runner/main.cpp` is stock.
- **CRITICAL — Backward-compatible DB schema:** ALWAYS add `#[serde(default)]` to ANY new field added to a persisted Rust struct (e.g., `ServerState`, any struct stored as JSON in SQLCipher). Without it, old data lacking the new field will fail to deserialize and silently disappear (servers vanish, data lost).
- **HollowTooltip: always use `_dismiss()` pattern** — tooltip hide must remove the overlay entry immediately (no reverse animation). Animated hide causes orphaned tooltips when parent widgets rebuild or leave the tree (e.g., call bar buttons disappearing on call end). The `_dismiss()` method must: set `_hovering = false`, stop + reset the animation controller, then `_entry?.remove()` + null. This applies to ALL `HollowTooltip` usages across the app.
- **CRITICAL — TURN ICE config: split URIs into separate entries.** flutter_webrtc's native C++ `CreateIceServers` has a single `uri` field per `IceServer` struct. Passing `urls: [list]` overwrites to only the last URI — other TURN transports are never tried. Always map each TURN URI to its own `{'urls': singleUri, 'username': ..., 'credential': ...}` entry in `ice_config_provider.dart`.
- **VPS SSH:** `ssh ubuntu@141.227.186.209` — key-only, no passphrase. Can be used freely for config checks, log inspection, deployments.

## Rules
- Never commit secrets, keys, or credentials
- Rust handles: networking (libp2p), crypto, CRDTs, storage engine
- Dart handles: UI, app logic, state management
- All crypto operations must use constant-time implementations
- Ask before making architectural decisions not covered in HOLLOW_PLAN.md
- When updating memory (MEMORY.md), also update this file (CLAUDE.md) if relevant
- **VPS deployment:** Ask user — never store credentials.
- **Local dev commands:** Can run `cargo check/test/clippy`, `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`, `flutter analyze` freely — these are local-only operations.
- **Building/running the app:** User runs `flutter run -d windows` themselves for testing on their two laptops.
