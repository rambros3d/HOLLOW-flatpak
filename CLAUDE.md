## Current Phase
**Phase 3: Servers & Channels** — In Progress.

Phases 1 (LAN E2EE chat), 2 (cross-network E2EE, prekey bundles, connection management, invite links), 2.5 (UI Foundation), 2.75 (Haven Design System v2), UI Polish Pass — all COMPLETE. WSS transport deployed.

**Phase 3 completed so far:**
- CRDT backend: `crdts` crate + custom `AdminLwwReg`, 18 Rust tests, HLC ordering, sync protocol
- Server creation + channel system UI (ServerStrip, ChannelSidebar, ChatPane, MemberPanel)
- Channel messaging: Olm E2EE fan-out, JSON envelope, `channel_messages` SQLCipher table, ChannelChatPane + ChannelMessageBubble
- Server settings UI: full tabbed panel (Overview/Channels/Members/Danger Zone), rename/delete server+channels, server description
- Server state reload from DB on restart (HLC re-initialized after deserialization)
- Performance: `Opacity`→`FadeTransition` fix on HavenPressable/HavenButton/HavenToggle
- Server invite join flow: `haven://join?server=<id>` links, `JoinServer` command, `ServerJoinRequest` message, auto-register in server signaling rooms on startup
- Message deduplication: sender timestamp in envelope, UNIQUE DB constraint, Rust-side dedup before emitting events
- Server/channel deletion broadcast: `ServerDeleteBroadcast` message propagates to all connected members
- Room gating: reject incoming CRDT state/ops for servers not joined or pending join
- Channel/server operation broadcast: all CRDT mutations broadcast to server members only (not all connected peers), receive handler emits specific events (ChannelAdded/Removed/Renamed, MemberJoined/Left)
- Connection status indicator: per-server online member count in channel header (green/yellow/red dot + X/Y count)
- Message history sync on reconnection: pull-based catch-up (`ChannelSyncRequest`/`ChannelSyncBatch`), `INSERT OR IGNORE` dedup, triggers on reconnect + on-demand channel open
- Peer reconnection: `disconnected_peers` cleared every 60s, CRDT sync on reconnect via `ConnectionEstablished`
- Olm session race fix: 3-layer PreKey defense (`try_decrypt_prekey_with_existing` → `create_inbound_session` → auto re-key)
- Olm session preservation: stopped destroying sessions on transport failure (`OutboundFailure`), preventing dual-outbound race
- Sync retry system: `MessageSyncFailed` event, `pending_sync_requests` retry after re-key, `flush_pending_sync_requests` helper
- Granular sync UI: `ServerSyncStatus` enum (idle/connecting/syncing/synced/retrying/failed), `_ConnectionIndicator` with StatusDot + retry button
- Graceful disconnect: `PeerDisconnecting` broadcast on app close, immediate `PeerDisconnected` event on receiver
- Member presence: ASOT-style Online/Offline dividers, per-member sync spinning icon, offline 0.5 opacity, sync progress "Syncing 47/120...", user bar mirrors channel status, DM spinning icon for unestablished sessions
- Perf optimization: eliminated Riverpod `ref`-passing anti-pattern in member panel (ConsumerWidget instead of passing ref)
- Peer reconnect visibility: server members not in `expected_peers` now get `PeerDiscovered` on `ConnectionEstablished`
- Header indicator cleanup: sync-only status (no redundant member count), fixed retry button

- Connectivity fixes: relay-first dialing (avoids stale address timeouts), ghost peer prevention (3-min disconnect cooldown), proactive Olm session on server join (KeyRequest in ServerJoinRequest/SyncResponse handlers)
- Roles & permissions: Discord-like hierarchy (Owner > Admin > Moderator > Member), Permission bitmask gating on all CRDT commands, role change/kick with hierarchy validation, role-colored ASOT dividers in member panel, permission-gated server settings tabs
- Role demotion fix: ChangeRole handler uses author's role priority (not target's) in CRDT op — ensures higher-ranked users can demote lower-ranked. AdminLwwReg merge correctly resolves.
- Kick propagation fix: broadcast targets collected BEFORE apply_op removes member. New `MemberKickBroadcast` message sent to kicked peer — triggers server removal + DB cleanup (like ServerDeleteBroadcast).
- Role colors: Owner = golden yellow (FBBF24), Admin = purple (A78BFA), Moderator = orange (lerp warning/error)
- Sync recovery: SessionEstablished clears failed sync status + auto-retriggers channel sync. No more stuck "Sync failed" after re-key.
- Permission loading: ServerSettingsPanel waits for myPermissionsProvider before rendering tabs (prevents flash of owner-level UI on non-owner peers)
- Per-message Ed25519 signing: canonical payload signing (`haven-msg:{type}:{context}:{sender}:{ts}:{text}`), sign before Olm encryption, verify after decryption, `sig`+`pk` fields in MessageEnvelope + SyncMessageItem (backward-compatible via `Option`), DB columns (`signature TEXT`, `public_key TEXT`) on both `channel_messages` and `messages`, DMs now wrapped in `MessageEnvelope::DirectMessage` with signing, Dart models carry `signature`/`publicKey` for future evidence export UI
- Per-sender channel sync: `ChannelSyncRequest` carries `sender_timestamps: HashMap<String, i64>` for per-sender gap detection (fixes timestamp blind spot where own message masks unseen messages from others)
- DM sync protocol: `DmSyncRequest`/`DmSyncBatch` pull-based catch-up, `DmSyncCompleted` event, triggered on `ConnectionEstablished`
- DM persistence moved to Rust: both sent (in `SendMessage` handler) and received (in `DirectMessage` handler) DMs persisted with Rust-generated/sender's `ts` — fixes timestamp mismatch that caused sync duplicates. Dart `chat_provider.dart` no longer saves DMs to DB, only updates in-memory UI state. `get_dm_messages_since()` only returns `is_mine = 1` (only sync what we sent).
- Signaling unregister on shutdown: `NotifyShutdown` sends `Unregister` for all rooms, fixing ghost online status on app restart

- MLS group encryption — DONE: OpenMLS 0.8, O(1) channel encryption. One MLS group per server. Single-committer model (owner). `MlsManager` in `crypto/mls_manager.rs`, 6 unit tests (33 total). Wire protocol: `MlsChannelMessage`, `MlsKeyPackage`, `MlsWelcome`, `MlsCommit`, `MlsKeyPackageRequest`. MLS identity persisted in `mls_identity` SQLCipher table. Full swarm integration: CreateServer creates MLS group, SendChannelMessage uses MLS when group exists (Olm fallback), JoinServer sends KeyPackage, KickMember rotates epoch, reconnect triggers KeyPackageRequest for non-MLS members. Tested on two laptops.
- Lock icon fix — DONE: `InboundCircuitEstablished` + `ConnectionEstablished` now emit `SessionEstablished` for existing Olm sessions (fixes DM lock icon missing after restart)
- UI staleness fixes — DONE: Three rounds of fixes. (1) Debounced PeerDisconnected (2s) + dedup PeerDiscovered via `discovered_peers` HashSet — prevents libp2p connection churn from thrashing Dart UI. (2) `MessageReceived` event now carries sender timestamp; `loadHistory()` replaces state instead of merging. (3) Double PeerDisconnected fix (graceful disconnect removes from `connected_peers`), DmSyncCompleted always emitted (even with 0 new messages — forces Dart reload from DB), `is_first_connection` check bypasses `num_established == 1` guard when peer was gracefully disconnected but old transport lingers.

**Next up (Phase 3 remaining):**
1. Offline message queuing (store-and-forward via online peers)
   - Message ordering: append at bottom (not insert by sender timestamp — abusable), sender timestamp = display metadata only
2. Device linking via QR code — requires MLS + CRDTs

## Haven Design System (Phase 2.75)
All UI interactions go through custom Haven widgets — no Material defaults anywhere. Change behavior in one place, applies everywhere.

- **HavenPressable** (`haven_pressable.dart`): Universal interaction widget. Press: opacity 0.85 + scale 0.98, spring physics reverse. Hover: smooth color transition 150ms + shadow lift. No ripple. `subtle` mode disables press animation (for list items like channel tiles, peer cards).
- **HavenButton** (`haven_button.dart`): 4 variants — `.filled()` (accent bg), `.ghost()` (transparent), `.outline()` (1px border), `.danger()` (error red). Self-contained StatefulWidget with own press/hover animation. Hover glow shadow (20% opacity, 8px blur). Props: `onPressed`, `child`, `icon`, `expand`, `compact`.
- **HavenTextField** (`haven_text_field.dart`): Single `TextField` with `OutlineInputBorder` (no wrapper container). `haven.elevated` fill, border color animates (border→accent on focus, →error on error). Focus glow (teal BoxShadow 15% opacity, 6px blur). Error shake animation. Optional `prefixIcon`, `borderRadius`, `isDense`.
- **HavenDialog** (`haven_dialog.dart`): `showHavenDialog()` uses `showGeneralDialog` with scale 0.95→1.0 + fade entrance (200ms). Full-screen glassmorphism: `BackdropFilter` in `transitionBuilder` blurs entire screen (animated 0→12 sigma). Barrier: 8% black. Dialog bg: 92% opacity, accent border, 24px shadow.
- **HavenTooltip** (`haven_tooltip.dart`): Overlay-based, 400ms hover delay, 100ms fade+slide entrance. Dark style.
- **HavenToast** (`haven_toast.dart`): Slide-up + fade, auto-dismiss. Three types: success/error/info. Only one visible at a time. Replaces SnackBar. Controller disposed only by widget's `dispose()` (prevents double-dispose).
- **HavenToggle** (`haven_toggle.dart`): Spring physics thumb, color crossfade track.
- **StatusDot** (`status_dot.dart`): StatefulWidget with optional `pulse` for breathing glow animation (3s cycle, BoxShadow). Used in peer cards, member tiles, user bar.

## Key Architecture Notes
- **Peer state tracking in swarm.rs:** `connected_peers`, `expected_peers`, `disconnected_peers` HashSets. Bootstrap handler skips disconnected + connected peers. `InboundCircuitEstablished` clears disconnected. `ConnectionEstablished` triggers proactive DHT prekey fetch for auto-encryption. Ping: 5s/5s. Rebootstrap: 60s unconditional.
- **Event streaming:** Rust→Dart via `StreamSink` (flutter_rust_bridge), not polling. `watch_network_events()` in `api/network.rs`, `EventStreamNotifier` in `event_provider.dart`
- **Navigation shell:** Discord-like 4-panel layout — ServerStrip (72px) | ChannelSidebar (240px) | ChatPane | MemberPanel (240px). Responsive: mobile uses bottom nav with single-panel views.
- **Window chrome:** `window_manager` ^0.5.1, `setAsFrameless()`, custom 32px title bar (`window_title_bar.dart`). Native Win32 changes in `windows/runner/` for dark bg brush, DWM compositing, no-flicker resize. Known issue: drag-from-maximized doesn't live-redraw until drop (Flutter engine limitation).
- **Theme:** Dark primary (default) + light secondary. `HavenTheme.dark()`/`.light()` ThemeExtension, `HavenThemeData.dark()`/`.light()` factories. Toggle via `themeModeProvider` (Riverpod StateProvider). No persistence yet (Phase 3). Frutiger Aero theme deferred as future third option.
- **Icons:** `lucide_icons: ^0.257.0`. All `LucideIcons.*` (camelCase). Note: v0.257.0 uses `alertTriangle`/`alertCircle` (not `triangleAlert`/`circleAlert`). No `cloudCheck` — uses `cloud`.
- `haven_log!` macro (`#[macro_export]` in lib.rs) logs to stderr + `haven_debug.log` (works in release builds)
- Relay: OVH VPS 141.227.186.209, Nginx TLS termination on 443 → plain WS on 127.0.0.1:9001
- Domain: relay.anonlisten.com (Hostinger DNS, Let's Encrypt cert)
- Connection priority: LAN (mDNS) → Hole punch (DCUtR) → QUIC relay → TCP relay → WSS relay
- libp2p SwarmBuilder chain: with_tcp → with_quic → with_dns → with_websocket → with_relay_client → with_behaviour

## Coding Conventions
- Dart: follow standard `flutter_lints` / `analysis_options.yaml`
- Rust: follow standard `cargo clippy` recommendations
- File naming: snake_case for Dart and Rust files
- No Electron, no Node.js, no web frameworks — Flutter only for UI
- **NEVER pass `WidgetRef ref` as a constructor parameter** to child widgets. Always use `ConsumerWidget` or `ConsumerStatefulWidget` instead. Passing `ref` causes cascade rebuilds (parent rebuilds ALL children on every provider change).
- Use `AnimatedOpacity` (GPU-composited) for per-item opacity. Never use the `Opacity` widget.
- **Keep Flutter updated:** Windows animation jank (choppy at all refresh rates) was caused by a Flutter engine bug present in 3.38.5, fixed in 3.41.4. No app-side hacks needed — just `flutter upgrade`. `windows/runner/main.cpp` is stock (no timer hacks).

## Rules
- Never commit secrets, keys, or credentials
- Rust handles: networking (libp2p), crypto, CRDTs, storage engine
- Dart handles: UI, app logic, state management
- All crypto operations must use constant-time implementations
- Ask before making architectural decisions not covered in HAVEN_PLAN.md
- When updating memory (MEMORY.md), also update this file (CLAUDE.md) if relevant
- **VPS deployment:** Ask user — requires SSH password, never store credentials. User deploys themselves.
- **Local dev commands:** Can run `cargo check/test/clippy`, `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`, `flutter analyze` freely — these are local-only operations.
- **Building/running the app:** User runs `flutter run -d windows` themselves for testing on their two laptops.
