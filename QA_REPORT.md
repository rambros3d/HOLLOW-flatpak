# Hollow Performance/Quality Audit — QA Report

**Date:** May 4, 2026
**Scope:** Full codebase audit across 5 domains (MLS+Crypto, UI Performance, Storage+CRDTs, Networking+WebRTC, Offline-to-Online)
**Status:** Tier 1-4 complete. Remaining items tracked below.

---

## Completed Fixes

### Tier 1 — Quick wins (all in swarm.rs Disconnected handler)
- [x] **H1 (CRITICAL):** `synced_peers.clear()` on WS disconnect — fixed all sync after network flaps
- [x] **M12:** CRDT SyncReq always plaintext after reconnection
- [x] **M13:** `mls_bootstrap_requested` 60s timeout (was permanent)
- [x] **M14:** Clear `key_request_in_flight` + `pending_messages` on disconnect

### Tier 2 — Important bugs
- [x] **H12+H13:** Edit/delete sync gap — `updated_at` column, sync query `OR updated_at >= ?`, message_id existence check before INSERT, edit/delete applied in sync batch receivers with event emissions
- [x] **H3:** HollowShell no longer watches full `chatProvider` — new `lastDmMessageProvider`
- [x] **H4:** `profileProvider` hoisted out of `itemBuilder` in both chat panes
- [x] **Relay backpressure:** 64KB→2MB soft, 256KB→4MB hard, stderr drop logging

### Tier 3 — Performance at scale
- [x] **H6+H7:** CrdtStore actor (`node/crdt_store.rs`) — one DB connection, batch-drain, 34 sync_handler sites refactored
- [x] **H5:** crdt_ops table pruning every 30min via `prune_ops(1000)` (ROW_NUMBER window function)
- [x] **H8:** MLS persistence via CryptoStore actor (20 call sites, no more per-call DB opens)
- [x] **H2:** Member panel virtualization — `_MemberListEntry` data class, truly lazy `ListView.builder`

### Tier 4 — Architectural scaling
- [x] **H9:** Vault coordinator separated from MLS coordinator (`elect_vault_coordinator` = 2nd-lowest peer). Adaptive MLS batch timer (2s→5s→10s based on queue depth)
- [x] **H10:** Relay topic-based channel routing — `0x07`/`0x08` frames, subscribe command, `send_mls_broadcast_topic()` for channel messages. Deployed to VPS
- [x] **H11:** Voice WebRTC hard caps — `maxVoicePcs=15`, `maxScreenShareOutgoing=5`, `maxScreenShareIncoming=3`

### Additional fixes discovered during implementation
- [x] **SFrame key initialization:** MLS epoch key now emitted on voice channel join + cached by Dart provider. `rotateKey` used instead of `setSharedKey`. `setKeyIndexForPeer` called after every cryptor creation. Fixed pre-existing black screen in voice channel screen share.

## Remaining Items (not yet fixed)

### MEDIUM Severity
| # | Domain | Title |
|---|--------|-------|
| M1 | UI | Each `_ServerMemberTile` watches entire profile map — use `.select()` |
| M2 | UI | HollowAvatar re-decodes image on reference change, not content change |
| M3 | UI | HollowPressable allocates AnimationController in `subtle` mode (never used) |
| M4 | UI | Member panel re-filters/re-groups on every provider change — computed provider |
| M5 | UI | All profiles (80+ MB avatar blobs) loaded into memory at startup |
| M6 | Storage | Server avatar in CRDT settings (133KB in every serialization). Hot/cold deferred — needs sync FFI read path fix |
| M7 | Storage | No message retention policy (~850 MB/server/year) |
| M8 | Storage | Full op_log (300-500 KB) sent as plaintext to new joiners |
| M9 | Storage | O(n) duplicate detection in `apply_op` — use HashSet for dedup |
| M10 | Storage | In-memory HashMaps never evicted (rate tokens, cooldowns, shard assembly) |
| M11 | Storage | Profile storage loads all avatar/banner blobs for every peer |
| M15 | MLS | MLS recovery only targets Owner, not current coordinator |
| M16 | MLS | Targeted MLS messages encrypt+broadcast to ALL members (O(n)) |
| M17 | MLS | Commits only sent to online members — offline permanently desync |
| M18 | Network | Gossip PeerExchange broadcasts topology to all room members |
| M19 | Network | WS stream transfer reads entire file (34 MB) into memory |
| M20 | Network | Gossip neighbor selection can exceed MAX_TOTAL_WEBRTC=50 cap |
| M21 | Network | Relay no text message size limit (DoS amplification) |
| M22 | Network | Relay silently drops messages under backpressure (now logged but not retried) |
| M23 | Network | Background bandwidth scales poorly at 1000+ members |
| M24 | Network | No file transfer resumption on WS disconnect |
| M25 | Offline | Voice channel participants not cleaned on disconnect |
| M26 | Offline | Pending friend requests not re-sent after app restart |
| M27 | Offline | Banned user retains server state until CRDT sync completes |
| M28 | Offline | @Mentions during offline sync don't trigger mention-specific unread |
| M29 | Offline | Voice ghost participants — no heartbeat/timeout cleanup |
| M30 | MLS | Channel visibility not cryptographically enforced (known, pre-v1.0) |

### LOW Severity
| # | Domain | Title |
|---|--------|-------|
| L1 | UI | Channel sidebar uses eager `ListView(children:)` |
| L2 | Storage | `banned_members` HashMap grows without bound |
| L3 | Storage | `channel_sync_sent` HashMap never pruned |
| L4 | Storage | `LIKE '%query%'` search without FTS index |
| L5 | Storage | No VACUUM/auto-vacuum for SQLCipher |
| L6 | MLS | KeyPackage accepted without CRDT membership verification |
| L7 | MLS | Remove-then-add recovery creates 2 epoch advances per peer |
| L8 | MLS | Ed25519 uses `verify()` not `verify_strict()` |
| L9 | MLS | Olm session count unbounded, no stale pruning |
| L10 | Network | Data channel backpressure uses polling instead of callbacks |
| L11 | Network | Gossip overlay `known_peers` not cleared on disconnect |
| L12 | Network | Relay rate limiter only applies to binary frames, not text |
| L13 | Network | No timeout for stale voice channel participants |
| L14 | Offline | Server invites have no expiry mechanism |
